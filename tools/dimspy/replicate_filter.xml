Description

|

Standard DIMS processing workflow: Process Scans -> **Replicate Filter** -> Align Samples -> [Missing value sample filter] -> Blank Filter -> Sample Filter -> Matrix processing -> Statistics

|


	To draw robust conclusions from DIMS-based metabolomics datasets, the data itself must be collected and processed in a robust and reproducible way. To support this aim, study samples are often divided in to a set of equivalent aliquots, each of which is analysed under defined and consistent analytical conditions. As aliquots of the same sample are assumed to comprise identical biological material, differences in their resulting spectra are assumed to arise due to technical variability. Removing artifacts associated with this technical variability, and removing mass spectral peaks that are detected irreproducible, is possible by filtering across these technical replicate spectra. The Replicate Filter tools facilitates this process, combining the peaklists extracted (using the Process Scans tool) from each technical replicate of a given study in to a single merged peaklist, before applying a series of user-defined filters to yield a replicate-filtered peaklist.
	
	|
	
	**Replicate filter process**: peaks from each technical replicate (for a given study sample) are aligned using a one-dimensional hierarchical clustering procedure (applied on the mass-to-charge scale). Peaks are aligned only if the difference in their mass-to-charge ratios, when divided by the average of their mass-to-charge ratios and multiplied by 1 × 10\ :sup:`6` \ (i.e. when measured in units of parts-per-million, ppm), is less-than or equal-to the user-defined ‘ppm error tolerance’. After alignment, a set of user-defined filters are applied to retain only those peaks that:

		* occur in equal-to or more-than the user-defined 'Number of technical replicates a peak has to be present in', i.e. if set to 2, then a peak must be detected in at least two of the replicate analyses, **and/or**
		
		|
		
		* have relative standard deviation (measured in %; may otherwise be referred to as the percent coefficient of variation) of intensity values, across technical replicates, that is equal-to or less-than the user-defined ‘relative standard deviation threshold’ (if defined, otherwise ignored). 

	|
	
	
	**IMPORTANT**:	
	
		* When a user sets the parameter “number of technical replicates for each sample” to a value less-than the total number of technical replicates actually acquired for each study sample, this tool will automatically determine which combination of technical replicates to combine. See the parameter description (below) for further details.
		
		|
		
		* If a specific scan event has been replicated within a given file, then users should not use this tool for filtering and aligning peaks. In this case, users should instead FIRST use the Process Scans (and SIM stitch) tool - see the documentation for the Process Scans tool for a description of how to perform this.

	|

	**Output** - a replicate-filtered peaklist per input study sample. In each, rows correspond to replicate-filtered mass spectral peaks, while columns provide a range of metrics for each of the detected peaks (see “Output file(s)” section, below). 

	|

------------------

Parameters
----------

|

	**Number of technical replicates for each sample** (REQUIRED; default = 3) - the total number of technical replicates acquired for each study sample. This value must be set to the lowest number of technical replicates acquired for ANY of the study samples, or alternatively, may be set to the minimum number of replicates the user would like to select from the total number of technical replicates for a biological sample.

	**Minimum number of technical replicates a peak has to be present in** (REQUIRED; default = 2) - For a given biological sample, the number of replicates that will be used to generate the replicate-filtered peaklist. By default, if this parameter is set to a value less-than the total number of technical replicates acquired for each biological sample, then the tool automatically determines which combination of technical replicates yields the best overall rank. Otherwise, all technical replicates are used. Ranking of the combinations of technical replicates is based on the average of the following three scores:

		# score 1: peak count / peak count present in n-out-n (e.g. 3-out-of-3)

		# score 2: peak count present in x-out-of-n (e.g. 3-out-of-3) / MAX peak count present in x-out-of-n across sets of replicates

		# score 3: RSD categories (0-5 (score=1.0), 5-10 (score=0.9), 10-15 (score=0.8), etc)

	**ppm error tolerance** (REQUIRED; default = 2) - this parameter will influence the alignment of peaks across technical replicates. Peaks from distinct technical replicates of a given study sample are aligned if the difference between their mass-to-charge ratios, when divided by the average of their mass-to-charge ratios and multiplied by 1 × 106, is equal-to or less-than than this parameter value (i.e. the difference between the mass-to-charge ratios, measured on the ppm scale, is less than the user-defined threshold). 

	**Relative standard deviation threshold** (OPTIONAL) - a numerical value from 0 upwards that defines the acceptable percentage relative standard deviation (otherwise termed the percent coefficient of variation) of a peak’s intensity across technical replicates. Peaks are removed from the output ‘replicate-filtered’ peaklist if this condition is not met.

-------------------

Output file(s)
--------------

|

The Replicate Filter tool will output three file types:

	|

	1) **A HDF5 file containing the replicate-filtered Peaklists**

	|

	2) **A replicate-filtered peaklist**, in .tsv format, for each biological sample defined in the filelist/samplelist. Tab-delimited text file containing a numeric data matrix, with . as decimal, and NA for missing values. Each row corresponds to a mass spectral peak. Columns provide metrics associated with each mass spectral peak. Metrics include:

		**mz** - the mass-to-charge ratio of a mass spectral peak, or the mean average mass-to-charge ratio of aligned mass spectral peaks from distinct technical replicates. 

		**intensity** - the intensity of a mass spectral peak, or the mean average of the intensities values of aligned mass spectral peaks from distinct technical replicates

		**snr** - the signal-to-noise ratio (snr) of a mass spectral peak, or the mean average of the signal-to-noise ratios of aligned mass-spectral peaks from distinct technical replicates.

		**present**: a positive numeric value indicating the total number of peaks aligned, across technical replicates, according to the user-defined ‘ppm error threshold’ value.

		**fraction**: a numerical value from 0 to 1 indicating the proportion of technical replicates in which the peak was detected (e.g. peak detected in 2 out of 3 replicates has a fraction of 0.66).

		**rsd**: the percent relative standard deviation for a set of aligned peaks across technical replicates. Where a peak is detected in only one technical replicate (as indicated by a ‘present’ value of ‘1’), the rsd is non-calculable and a ‘nan’ is inserted instead.

		**occurrence**: a positive integer value indicating the total number of distinct mass spectral peaks aligned during replicate filtering. This number may occasionally be greater than the total number of replicates. This occurs when a peak with a highly-similar mass-to-charge ratio falls within the user-defined ppm error threshold for a group of aligned peaks.

		**purity**: a numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion of replicate peaklists that have only a single peak within the user-defined ppm error range.

		**present_flag**: a boolean value indicating whether a peak is retained or discarded based on whether it was detect in equal-to or greater-than the user-defined ‘minimum fraction’ of samples (1 = keep, 0 = discard).

		**flags**: a boolean value indicating whether a peak should be retained or discarded based upon its ‘present_flag’ and its rsd value. E.g. if ‘present_flag’ is set to 0, or if the rsd value for the peak is greater than the user-defined rsd threshold, then the ‘flags’ column should be set to 0 (1 = keep, 0 = discard).
